Hello! Hope everyone is having an excellent year so far!

Pizza Clicker is an Idle Game targeted for Android devices - you can download it [here!](https://fourthdimension.studio/pizzaclicker/)

Late December I planned a New Year's Update for Pizza Clicker, and it is finally here!

## The Update

The Update was mainly just me adding some content and setting grounds to the next major update, which, unfortunately, should be available only in February.

1. A change was me reorganizing and changing prices on old upgrades that already existed, making the progression faster;
2. Added 1 more upgrade for each incrementer in the game, which means a total of **8 new upgrades**;
3. Added a new kind of upgrade, an upgrade that when bought, makes a new Hire available, the **Gennaro's Uncle Grandpa**;
4. Added 7 more pieces of news, because the way they were revealed was slow, so I thought I needed more.

## Roadmap

What's going on right now is that I'm focusing more on other projects, I'm building an Idle Framework. A Framework that will make it easier to create idle games, be it a standard idle (just like Pizza Clicker!) or one of those RPG similar idles, where you have two currencies going on. This project was born from Pizza Clicker.

The other thing that is going on is that I will start to work on a new game, at the moment it does not have a name, but I'm calling it Project Mobile Dreamlands, it is some sort of mobile runner roguelike, I will be posting more about it soon!

**About Pizza Clicker**, I have two major update planned, which is Version 4 and Version 5. Version 5 will be definitely the end of the game and, after that, I will just update some minor fixes and maybe more upgrades/incrementer, very few of my time will be with Pizza Clicker after V5.

But as I said previously, Version 4 is due to February only and Version 5 maybe will reach the stores in March, I still have some planing to do! Until then, Pizza Clicker has a really long road in front of it.

That's what has changed in Pizza Clicker for this update. Hope you like it!
