## What's next?

I honestly don't know what's next, I came up with "Fourth Dimension" more than a year ago with the idea of making simple and fun games, but the truth is that I wanted some kind of safe environment to make and publish experimental games, short games, games with a simple story and things like, the purpose is to try new things and make broaden people's views on what games can do, maybe that's the new goal? For now I have no project in mind, so only time will tell what happens.
